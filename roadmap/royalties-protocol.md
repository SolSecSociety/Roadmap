* **33.3%** Goes to **"The Hell Protocol"**

* **33.3%** Goes to **Marketing & Development** \


**When Staking will be Released**, Royalties will get Updated:

* **57%** Goes directly to **Marketing & Development**
* **33.3%** Goes as always to **"The Hell Protocol"**
* **9.7%** Goes to the **Team**

### The Hell Protocol

"The Hell Protocol" will work as a BuyBack & Burner Wallet, backed by 1/3 of Royalties raised (33.3%).\
This wallet will function as a growing fund that will be entirelly used to buy back our NFTs at the floor price, but what's crazier, the NFTs we buy will be burnt and gone for good, reducing the supply.

About rarity, keep in mind: ‚ÄúCommons will become rare.‚Äù Let's assume that the floor mostly consists of common NFTs. As we sweep the floor and burn those NFTs, the supply will be significantly decreased raising the NFT value for every holder!\

**Burner Wallet address:** [BurNycC5v567ZKDMFBhz5ihM6LtyonEMbTzmNfFsBWrA ](https://solscan.io/account/BurNycC5v567ZKDMFBhz5ihM6LtyonEMbTzmNfFsBWrA)\
\*\*Fell Free to send scam coins/NFTs to this burner address to get rid of them.



### Airdrops

Holders of **10 random NFTs** from our collections (Solenoids + ChurChain) will receive a divine blessing from heaven. 33% of the weekly SOL Royalties raised will be Airdropped every Sunday (more volume = higher prizes)
