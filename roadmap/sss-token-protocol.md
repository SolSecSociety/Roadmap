# ðŸª™ SSS Token Protocol

**SSS Token** will be the fuel that powers the entire ecosystem\
\
Ok, but How ? Here comes the funny part\
\
First, SSS token is an SPL token crafted on the Solana Blockchain.

### Maximum Supply

* The maximum supply is **11,111,111 SSST and will start from 0**
* There will be 3 mining periods. **Each time a period ends we will reduce SSST staking rewards by 40%.**
  * **1:** 4,000,000 SSST tokens mined.
  * **2:** 7,000,000 SSST tokens mined.
  * **3:** 9,000,000 SSST tokens mined.

### Pray to Earn Ability

The only way to mine SSS Token is to Stake your NFTs:

* Solenoids has the ability to mine 10 SST x Day
* Priests has the ability to mine 6 SST x Day
* Nuns has the ability to mine 5 SSST x Day
* Churches has the ability to mine 12 SSST x Day
* The only way NFTs can mine SSST is via staking.

### Extra Ability (AutoDistruction):

#### Only for "The Solenoids"

*   Solenoids can be burned by their holder to claim SSST held by the SSS treasury.

    * Burning mechanics will be announced soon.
    * Since the burn is paid by the SSS Treasury, if there isn't enough SSST in the Treasury, then the burn is queued.

    &#x20;
* A "Burned" Solenoid is a Solenoid that's removed from circulation.&#x20;

This is the formula used to calculate the amount of SSST a Solenoid can claim via burn:

```
SSST token quantity = 1000 - #Affiliated Number Trait (here explained Solenoid Rarity)
```



### SSS Token Utilities

### SSS Store

* SSS will host SSST auctions & raffles for:
  * Exclusive Whitelist Spots
  * NFTs held in the SSS Treasury (link all'address)
  * and a lot more...
* Buy-it-now "The Churchain Trilogy or Solenoids" listings .
  * In the future, SSS Treasury could also acquire their own NFTs and list them for SSST on the SSS Store.
  * The Price will be calculated via the Burning formula for "The Solenoids" and via Rarity for "The ChurChain trilogy":\
    &#x20;SSST Quantity = 1000 + (# of Remaining DeGods - Rarity Ranking)

{% hint style="info" %}
All SSST collected from the SSS Store will be held by the SSS Treasury.

7.77% of SSST collected is distributed to our Core Team.
{% endhint %}

### Upgrades (Just an idea)

* &#x20;We are also working on Upgraded Abilities on our Collections, for example the ability to Evolve the NFT to gain a boost on the staking.
  * cost 1111 To evolve an NFTs
  * generate 2x daily SSST yield.
  * replace the image & metadata of the upgraded NFT.
* visual traits will also be updated & rarity could be affected.
  * the metadata will be updated with a new "Upgraded" attribute.
* There will be no separate NFT/serum.
  * upgrade applied directly to holder's selected NFT after SSST purchase.

### Solana Ecosystem

* The SSS will actively be seeking & responding to opportunities to integrate our native SSS token utility into major projects in the Solana Ecosystem.
* Examples Include:
  * PvP & P2E NFT Games
  * Casino/Betting Platforms
  * Metaverse Integrations
  * Accepted Currency in Marketplaces\
