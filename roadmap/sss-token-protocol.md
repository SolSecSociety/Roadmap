# ðŸª™ SSS Token Protocol

**SSS Token** will be the fuel that powers the entire ecosystem, it is a SPL token crafted on the Solana Blockchain.

Right, but How ? Here comes the exciting part

### Tokenomics

* The maximum supply is **11,111,111 SSST and will start from 0 SSST**
* There will be 3 staking subsequent periods. **The end of each period will reduce SSST staking rewards by 1 token..**
  * **Period 1:** starting at 3,000,000 SSST tokens mined.
  * **Period 2:** starting at 6,000,000 SSST tokens mined.
  * **Period 3:** starting at 9,000,000 SSST tokens mined.

### Pray to Earn Ability

The only way to mine SSS Token is by Staking your NFTs:

* **Solenoids** has the ability to mine **7 SST** x Day
* **Priests** has the ability to mine **6 SST** x Day
* **Nuns** has the ability to mine **5 SSST** x Day
* **Churches** has the ability to mine **9 SSST** x Day
* _The only way to mine SSST is via NFT staking_.

### Extra Ability (Self Destruction):

#### For "The Solenoids" only

*   Solenoids can be burned by their holder to claim SSST held by the SSS treasury.

    * Burning mechanics will be managed manually on our Ends.
    * Since the burn is paid by the SSS Treasury, if there isn't enough SSST in the Treasury, then the burn is queued.

    &#x20;
* A "Burned" Solenoid is gone for good and can't be recovered, inevitably reducing the Supply.&#x20;

Here is the formula used to calculate the amount of SSST a Solenoid can claim via burn:

```
SSST token quantity = 1000 - #Affiliated Number Trait (here explained Solenoid Rarity)
```



### SSS Token Utilities

### SSS Store

* SSS will host SSST auctions and/or raffles for:
  * Exclusive Whitelist Spots;
  * NFTs held in the SSS Treasury ([BANKBtNejPr5sz1haNASm2r4FsMkbDN3eRZs91bz9PaF](https://solscan.io/account/BANKBtNejPr5sz1haNASm2r4FsMkbDN3eRZs91bz9PaF))
  * and a lot more...
* **Buy-it-now-events** for "The Churchain Trilogy or Solenoids" listings.
  * In the future, SSS Treasury could also acquire their own NFTs and list them for SSST on the SSS Store.
  * The Price will be calculated via the Burning formula for "The Solenoids" and via Rarity for "The ChurChain trilogy":\
    &#x20;SSST Quantity = 1000 + (# of Remaining DeGods - Rarity Ranking)
